/*🧮 Problem Title: The Farmer’s Fencing Problem
💡 Problem Story:
A farmer named Raju owns a rectangular piece of land.
He wants to build a fence around it and also plant crops inside the land.

To plan the fencing and crop area, he needs to calculate:

The area of the rectangle (for crops).

The perimeter of the rectangle (for fencing).

He knows the length and width of the land in meters.
Can you help Raju write a program to find both the area and perimeter of his land?

🧠 Task:
Write a program that takes two integers as input — the length and width of the rectangle —
and prints the area and perimeter.

📥 Input Format:
The first line contains two integers,
length and width — dimensions of the rectangle.

📤 Output Format:
Print two lines:

First line: "Area = <value>"

Second line: "Perimeter = <value>"*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int length, width;
    cout <<"Enter the  value of length and width" <<endl;

    cin >> length >> width;
    int area = length * width;
    int perimeter = 2 * (length + width);


    cout << "Area = " << area << endl;
    cout << "Perimeter = " << perimeter << endl;

    return 0;
}
